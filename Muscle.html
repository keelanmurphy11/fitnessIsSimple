            <h1 class="overlay">Strength Training & Muscle Mass</h1>
          </div>
        
      
        <h2>The Importance of Muscle Mass</h2>
        <p>
            Studies have shown significant correlation between muscle mass, strength and mortality. Whether this is a direct cause or a knock on effect (e.g. inability to stay active) is less clear. However to me this is unimportant.</p>
        <p>
            It is undeniable that improved muscle mass and strength allows one to stay physically active as they age reducing overall mortality risk and improving quality of life. Strength training is also key for preventing osteoporosis (loss of bone denisty), and increased muscle mass will aid in weight management as it increases your BMR (the amount of calories your body burns each day at rest). </p>
      
        <h2>Who Should Be Strength Training?</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone! Age related muscle loss begins as early as thirty. Muscle mass decreases approximately 3–8% per decade after the age of 30.</p>
        <p>
            As we age this rate of muscle loss only speeds up, which if unaddressed can lead to an inability to perform simple daily tasks, a loss of independence, fragility, falls and need for full time care.</p>
        <p>
            Thankfully this process of muscle loss can easily be slowed by strength training. If you are are not yet affected by age related muscle loss, you should focus on building a solid base so that when you inevitably do start to lose muscle you still have enough to live an active, healthy lifestyle. It is never too late to start, no matter your age you can still improve your strength and muscle function as well as reduce further decline.</p>
        <p>
            Another key consideration is that preserving muscle mass will ensure you are continually able to train your cardiovascular system which as we know is <a href="Cardio.html">one of the biggest indicators of lifespan.</a> </p>
      
        <h2>How to Strength Train</h2>
        <p>
            These days online there is so much information and varying opinions on exercise selection, training splits, must do exercises etc. This can all be very confusing and makes weight training seem complicated. In reality it is very simple. There are only a few simple things to consider; Frequency, intensity, progressive overload, technique, rest. </p>
      
        <h3>Frequency</h3>
        <p>
            Aim to train each muscle group twice a week, This can easily be accomplished by two full body days. Sessions do not have to be long. Two 45-60 minute workouts focussing on compound movements (movements involving multiple muscles) is plenty. </p>
      
        <h3>Intensity</h3>
        <p>
            Intensity is the thing that people get wrong most often. Workouts need to be challenging. You must push close to the point of failure (failure = point where you could not possibly do another repitition). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Often people overestimate how hard they are working. e.g. they stop at 10 reps thinking that’s all they can do when really they could do closer to 15. For this reason, once confident with the exercise technique, I believe you should take a set of each exercise (that you can perform safety) to failure at least once every few sessions so that you know where your point of failure is. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You should then train to or close to (within 3 reps of) this point of failure every set. Your body does not want to build muscle it is a costly process and it requires energy (calories) to maintain muscle mass. When we strength train we are essentially showing our bodies that we are incapable of completing this task (lifting the weight) and therefore need to adapt, build more muscle and get stronger. 
        <span class="bold">If we do not train hard, we do not stimulate this adaptation.</span>
        </p>
      
        <h3>Progressive Overload</h3>
        <p>
            Progressive overload links closely with the above point on intensity. Progressive overload essentially means trying to train a little bit harder each session. This can be accomplished by trying to add reps, sets or weight. Progressive overload is key to ensuring intensity remains high, if training is effective what was hard at the start of the training block is likely not hard now.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Technique</h3>
        <p>
            Ensuring proper technique will help you avoid injury and ensure you are training the targeted muscles. Ask a personal trainer to check your technique or watch a video on YouTube to ensure you are performing the exercise properly. 
        <p>When it comes to tempo (speed of lifts), focus on contracting fast and controlling the lengthening phase of the movement, taking at least a full second. In a squat this would look like controlling the way down and standing back up fast. 
        </p>
        <p>Rep ranges and sets: The number of repetitions you do of each exercise doesn’t matter that much as long as you are pushing each set close to failure. The general recommendation is between 8-12 reps for 2-3 sets. How many sets you do per muscle group will vary greatly depending on your training split.
        </p>
        
            
        <h3>Rest</h3>
        <p>
            Rest and recovery is key, in between sets take at least one minute rest. Listen to your body and rest as long as it needs, the more time between sets the better. 
            <br>Take at least one days rest between training each muscle group. During this time prioristise sleep and eating a protein rich diet. Note: when you first start training, your muscles will be very sore after working out this is normal. Over time the feelings of fatigue will reduce.
        </p>
        <div class="note-box">Note: Muscle damage/ muscle pain does not drive muscle growth. You do not need to be sore after a workout for it to be effective.</div>
      
        <h2>How to Make Strength Training Enjoyable</h2>
        <p>
          Enjoyment is the key to consistency. Strength training can feel pretty repetitive compared to other forms of activity, but there are plenty of ways to make it more fun:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Listen to music</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Track your progress</strong> — it boosts motivation, you don't always realise the progress you're making and helps you progressive overload. Try an app like RepCount.</li>
          <li><strong>Have a “gym only” podcast or show</strong>that you watch/listen to while training. This way you look forward to going to the gym to watch that next episode.</li>
          <li><strong>Find a gym buddy </strong>— it’s more fun and you’ll keep each other accountable.</li>
          <li><strong>Create a positive routine around training </strong>— e.g. Maybe you don't like going to the gym but you do love reading in the coffee shop nearby. By combining these (Going to the cafe after you workout) you can create a positive training experience, and again you'll look forward to going to the gym.</li>
        </ul>
